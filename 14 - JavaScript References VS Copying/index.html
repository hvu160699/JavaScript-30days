    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = 'Edward';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Vu'
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // At the moment, team is not an array, it's just a references to the original array (players)
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'John'
    console.log(players, team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = 'Doe'
    console.log(players, team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'Wes'
    console.log(players, team4)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.number = 99;
    console.log(person2, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Object.assign is very shallow, only goes 1 level deep
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 })
    console.log(person3, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = { ...person };
    person4.age = 40;
    console.log(person4, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // Or using cheating way (JSON)
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    const person5 = Object.assign({}, wes);
    person5.social.facebook = 'developer.wesbos';
    console.log(person5, wes);

    const person6 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
    person6.social.facebook = 'developer.wes';
    console.log(person6, wes)
